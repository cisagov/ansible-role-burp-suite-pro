This is a skeleton project that can be used to quickly get a new
[cisagov](https://github.com/cisagov) Ansible role GitHub project
started, where that Ansible role requires an AWS test user for
automated testing.

This skeleton project contains [licensing information](LICENSE), as
well as [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com) and [GitHub
Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) configurations
appropriate for an Ansible role, as well as the Terraform code to
create the AWS test user.

## Pre-requisites ##

In order to execute the Molecule tests for this Ansible role in GitHub
Actions, a build user must exist in AWS. The accompanying Terraform
code will create the user with the appropriate name and
permissions. This only needs to be run once per project, per AWS
account. This user can also be used to run the Molecule tests on your
local machine.

Before the build user can be created, the following profile must exist in
your AWS credentials file:

* `cool-terraform-backend`

The easiest way to set up that profile is to use our
[`aws-profile-sync`](https://github.com/cisagov/aws-profile-sync)
utility. Follow the usage instructions in that repository before
continuing with the next steps. Note that you will need to know where
your team stores their remote profile data in order to use
[`aws-profile-sync`](https://github.com/cisagov/aws-profile-sync).

To create the build user, follow these instructions:

```console
cd terraform
terraform init --upgrade=true
terraform apply
```

Once the user is created you will need to update the [repository's
secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets)
with the new encrypted environment variables. This should be done
using the
[`terraform-to-secrets`](https://github.com/cisagov/development-guide/tree/develop/project_setup#terraform-iam-credentials-to-github-secrets-)
tool available in the [development
guide](https://github.com/cisagov/development-guide). Instructions for
how to use this tool can be found in the ["Terraform IAM Credentials
to GitHub Secrets"
section](https://github.com/cisagov/development-guide/tree/develop/project_setup#terraform-iam-credentials-to-github-secrets-).
of the Project Setup README.

If you have appropriate permissions for the repository you can view
existing secrets on the [appropriate
page](https://github.com/cisagov/ansible-role-burp-suite-pro/settings/secrets)
in the repository's settings.

## New Repositories from a Skeleton ##

Please see our [Project Setup guide](https://github.com/cisagov/development-guide/tree/develop/project_setup)
for step-by-step instructions on how to start a new repository from
a skeleton. This will save you time and effort when configuring a
new repository!
